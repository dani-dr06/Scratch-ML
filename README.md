# Scratch-ML: Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

The purpose of this repository is to test/improve my knowledge on machine learning by coding algorithms from scratch. While this project is a work in progress, my goal is to implement 
models myself and compare them to other frameworks, namely Scikit-Learn.

## Models

Below you may find the models I have implemented.
